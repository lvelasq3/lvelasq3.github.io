I’m **Lorena Velásquez**, a PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at **Johns Hopkins University**, working in the Haptics and Medical Robotics Laboratory.

I investigate the ** form, function, and control of tendon-driven upper limb prosthetic devices**.  My goal is to create devices that improve **task performance, force distribution, and user comfort**, while reducing the **cognitive workload** associated with prosthesis use.

My research integrates:

- Biologically informed mechanical design 
- State-based haptic feedback
- Prosthetic Device Control
- Musculoskeletal-informed control strategies
- Multimodal workload assessment 

I expect to graduate in **May 2026** and am seeking **postdoctoral opportunities beginning Fall 2026**.

## Research Focus

### Tendon-Actuated Prosthetic Design
Comparative evaluation of biologically inspired and baseline tendon-driven end effectors across activities of daily living.

### Sensory Feedback Integration
Mapping internal device state to intuitive haptic cues to reduce monitoring demand.

### Cognitive Workload During Prosthesis Use
Multimodal assessment using neural, behavioral, and subjective metrics.

### Customizable Prosthesis Generation (HAMR)
User-specific design pipeline integrating 3D scanning, CAD parameterization, and additive manufacturing.
